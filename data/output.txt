STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS  The Bank will mail a Statement of transactions in the Card Account every month on a pre-determined date, to the mailing address provided by the Cardmember. Non-receipt of the Statement for any reasons whatsoever is not a valid reason for non-payment of dues. Should the Cardmember not receive the Statement within 7 days from the usual Statement date, the Cardmember is requested to call the HDFC Bank Credit Card Division to check the amount payable. Requests for duplicate Statements will attract charges as determined by the Bank from time to time. The Statement date is pre-determined and cannot be changed. The Cardmember further agrees that the Bank may round off the bill as determined appropriate by the Bank from time to time. The amount paid in excess of the actual bill amount will be adjusted in the next billing cycle. The Cardmember should promptly notify the Bank of any unauthorised transactions appearing on the Statement to enable investigation/amendments (if necessary). These transactions should be notified/referred within 30 days from the date of the Statement, after the expiry of which the Bank will not be liable for any refunds that may be related to such transactions.

Unless the interest free period applies as set out below, HDFC Bank will levy an interest on any new purchase (and any related debited charge) from the day on which the purchase (and any related debited charge) is transacted on the Card Account. The interest free period for a purchase (and any related debited charge) in any Statement period will apply if the outstanding balance on the Card Account for the previous Statement period (if any) is paid in full by its Due Date. If the outstanding balance on the Card Account is not paid in full by its Due Date, finance charge will be levied on any new purchase (and any related debited charge) from the day on which the purchase (and any related debited charge) is transacted on the Card Account and on the outstanding account balance on the Card Account from the first day of the last Statement period. HDFC Bank will charge interest on a Cash Advance from the day on which the Cash Advance is transacted on the Card Account till the date of repayment of the Cash Advance (including cash interest accrued thereof) in full. HDFC Bank will ordinarily levy interest on the purchase balance outstanding on the Card Account on a daily basis by applying its current daily percentage rate to the amount of the purchase balance outstanding at the end of each day. HDFC Bank will levy a finance charge on Cash Advance balances on a daily basis by applying its current daily percentage rate to the amount of the Cash Advance balance at the end of each day. The interest as above, will continue to be payable after termination of this Agreement or closure of the Card Account until the card balance is cleared in full. HDFC Bank may at any time, under intimation to the Cardmember, vary the interest to take into account prevailing interest rates, market forces and credit and business risks. The Bank may offer differential rates on preferential Cardmember behaviour. This is entirely at the discretion of the Bank and could mean revision of interest rates higher or lower than the rate prevailing at that point of time.  GOVERNMENT FEES AND CHARGES  Various government duties, rates, taxes or charges will apply to and be payable by the Cardmember for the operation of the Credit Card Account. The Cardmember agrees to reimburse the Bank for payment of any such taxes, rates or charges or other similar taxes or levies payable in connection with any advances, finances or credit provided by the Bank to the Cardmember.  GOODS & SERVICES TAX (GST)  The applicable GST would be dependent on place of provision (POP) and place of supply (POS).If POP and POS is in the same state then applicable GST would be CGST and SGST/UTGST else, IGST.  •   GST For FEE & Charges / Interest transactions Billed on statement date will reflect in next month statement.  • G ST levied will not be reversed on Any dispute on Fee & Charges / interest.  PAYMENTS  As per the RBI guidelines, in case the amount on account of use of the card overseas is greater than the Cardmember ’ s Foreign Exchange entitlements, the Cardmember should provide the reimbursement claimed, and the Bank is authorised to report the matter to the Regional Office of the Exchange Control Department giving full details. However, under no circumstances should the payment of the Credit Card bill/dues be delayed or refused on the grounds of the Cardmember having exceeded the entitlement. There will be no obligation on HDFC Bank to make a claim or demand for payment on a Cardmember and non-payment shall render the Cardmember liable to risk of withdrawal (whether temporarily or permanently) of his Cardmembership.  Monthly repayments to Cardmember ’ s Card Account:  •   Amounts which are payable immediately  OVERLIMIT AMOUNT If at any time, the outstanding balance on the Statement of Account exceeds the approved credit limits, this Overlimit amount must be paid immediately. OVERDUE AMOUNT  If ‘Minimum Amou n t Due’   remain unpaid from previous Statements of Account, these overdue amounts must be paid immediately.  •   Amounts which are payable by the   ‘Due D at e’  Each month the Cardmember may pay as much as he/she wishes towards the   ‘Closing   Balance’   shown on the Statement of Account, provided the payment is not less than the amount shown on the Statement of Accoun t as the ‘Minimum  Amount Due ’ . If the Cardmember does not wish to pay the full amount of the closing balance shown on the monthly Statement of Account he/she can avail of the Revolving Credit facility and will need to pay only the Minimum Amount Due as shown on Statement of Account. All payments must be made prior to the Due Date, irrespective of whether or not Statement has been received by the Cardmember. Non-receipt of a Statement will not be considered a valid reason for non-payment. In the event that the Cardmember has not received the Statement, he/she can calculate the amount based on the unpaid charge slips in his/her possession. The Minimum Amount Due will be 5% (or any other percentage as advised from time to time) of the Statement Closing

[PAGE 8]
Balance or Rs. 200, (or such other amount as notified from time to time), whichever is greater. (This does not apply to cancelled or closed cards in case of which full outstanding amount needs to be cleared immediately on demand). If the closing balance is less than Rs. 200 (or such other amount as notified from time to time) it must be paid in full. In certain type of cards   ‘Minimum   Amoun t Due’   can be equal to   ‘ Total Amount Due ’ . Please check the Minimum Amount Due carefully before making the payment to the Bank. The Due Date for payment (which presently would be approximately 20 days from the Statement date) is the last date by which the payments should reach the Bank. It may be noted that the Due Date is only a convenience to enable Statements to reach the Cardmember and also to provide time to process the Cardmember ’ s payments. Future transactions on the account may be declined if the payment is not received within the Due Date and all transactions will attract service charges from the date of purchase. The Cardmember ’ s payments will first be applied to all overdue amounts (the oldest due being credited first) in the following order:  •   Fees and other Charges  •   Interest  •   Cash Advances Billed  •   Retail Transactions Billed  •   Cash Advances Current  •   Retail Transactions Current Payment will be treated as made from the date on which the payments are credited to the Card Account in the ordinary course of business. Payments made by cheque drawn on a location where the Bank does not have a branch will be subject to a processing and handling fee as determined by the Bank from time to time, in addition to Drawee Bank ’ s charges for all outstation cheques. Generally, payments made in cash or through Direct Banking Channels will be credited to the Card Account within 2 business days, provided, they are made prior to the close of business hours as applicable. Proceeds of payments to the Account such as cheques cannot be used or withdrawn until funds are confirmed as cleared. If, for any reason (whether at Cardmember ’ s request or otherwise) the Bank allows withdrawal or use of the proceeds of the cheque or other such payment before it has been cleared, the Bank will be entitled to debit the Card Account, in the event that the cheque or other such payment is later dishonoured and the Cardmember shall be completely liable to make payments thereof and on account thereof. Payment towards multiple Card Accounts (held by the same Cardmember or otherwise) cannot be made vide a single cheque. The Bank does not undertake the responsibility of apportionment of such payment as may be desired by the Cardmember. If the Cardmember is not going to be able to access his/her mail around the period that he/she usually receives the Statement, it would be the Cardmember ’ s responsibility to make arrangements to ensure that at least the Minimum Amount Due reaches the Bank before the Payment Due Date. The Bank has made arrangements to provide Drop Box facilities at various locations in serviceable cities as determined by the Bank from time to time. The updated list of Drop Box locations may be communicated to the Cardmember as appropriate. The Cardmember is advised to use these Drop Boxes to deposit only locally payable cheques or drafts along with Payment Vouchers/stubs (tear off portion of Statement) duly completed with the cheque details. Cardmembers are advised not to issue post dated cheques towards card outstanding as the Bank does not in the normal course of operations offer to clear post dated cheques. Timely payment towards the card dues is essential and it is a condition of this Agreement that all the payments towards Minimum Amount Due must reach HDFC Bank on or before the Payment Due Date indicated in the monthly Statement of Account. If the Minimum Amount Due is not paid by the Payment Due Date, a late payment fee as specified in the tariff sheet will be debited to the Card Account and is subject to change at the discretion of HDFC Bank. Non-payment of card dues shall also render the Cardmember liable to risk of instant withdrawal of the Cardmembership without prior notice.  RETURNED PAYMENTS  In case the cheque or any other payment instrument forwarded by the Cardmember is not honoured or must be returned to the Cardmember because it cannot be processed, HDFC Bank reserves the right to proceed legally against the Cardmember and would at its discretion levy a penal fee and/or temporarily withdraw credit facilities on the card. Repeated instances of payment instruments not being honoured could result in cancellation of the Account. A cheque return fee at the prevailing rate would be levied on the amount of the returned cheque subject to a minimum amount as specified by the Bank from time to time. The attention of the Cardmember is invited to the provisions of Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and to the serious criminal penalties therein specified for the dishonour of cheques.  AUTO DEBIT  If the Cardmember has a Current Account or a Savings Account at any of our branches in India, the Bank may at its sole

[PAGE 9]
discretion arrange to have any one of these accounts debited automatically every month on the Cardmember ’ s written request. The Cardmember may note that the Auto Debit facility will not be available on certain classes of Accounts as determined by the Bank from time to time. Accounts currently residing in MicroBanker will not be eligible to participate in this facility. The Automatic debit will be processed on the registered account nominated by the Cardmember from the Payment Due Date and will be credited to the Card Account. In the event of non-realization of payment in the first attempt, repeat attempts will be made until realization of payment. In the event of non-realisation of payment in the first attempt, repeat attempts will be made until realization of payment. Cardmember must have sufficient cleared funds in the nominated Savings or Current Account at the time of the debit being processed. In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to clear the Card Account balance fully (i.e., 100% Auto Debit) each month, but the cleared balance available in the nominated Savings or Current Account is insufficient in any month, the Auto Debit service will instead claim only the Minimum Amount Due (if the cleared balance in the nominated Account is sufficient to cover the Minimum Amount Due). Where the Auto Debit service claims the Minimum Amount Due, and the nominated Savings or Current Account does not have sufficient funds to meet the claim, the amount will be reversed to Cardmember ’ s Card Account and the auto pay reversal charges at the prevailing rate would be levied to the Card Account. However, Auto Debit instruction for all subsequent months will continue to be effective as per the original instructions given by the Cardmember. The Bank reserves the right to accept and/or subsequently cancel or not to accept any such instructions. In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and there is a credit or a payment made to the Card Account before the Payment Due Date, the Bank may at its discretion claim only the residual amount i.e., the difference between the amount outstanding as per the Statement and the payments/ other credits received before the Payment Due Date. The Bank reserves the right to amend its policies with respect to such instructions from time to time. In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and in the event of non-recovery of funds, the Bank will attempt to recover at least the Minimum Amount Due on the Card Account. In future, the Bank may introduce at its discretion a variable option for Auto Debit facility. Where the Cardmember has opted for a variable amount and the Minimum Amount Due payable on the Card Account is higher than the option exercised, the Bank reserves the right to claim the higher of the two. If the Auto Debit cannot be claimed for insufficient funds on the recovery date, the Auto Debit reversal charges would be levied irrespective of any other payment/credit made into the Card Account through any other mode other than Auto Debit. The Bank at a predetermined overdue status would reserve the right to withdraw the standing instructions given by the Cardmember without any prior notice and the facility may not be made available in future. In a specific case where, subsequent to providing instruction to the Bank to Auto Debit a nominated Account, the nominated Account is closed or transferred to another branch, the Cardmember undertakes to advise the Cards Services Division of the Bank of the change in status of the nominated Account. Please note that the service or penal charges that accrue to the Cardmember ’ s Account because of non-compliance or delay of this advice will not be refunded.

In any of these events, electronic access to the nominated accounts may be withdrawn without prior notice to the Cardmember, without any liability devolving upon the Bank for such withdrawal. The Bank will advise the Cardmember of his/her PIN in a secure manner. On receipt of this PIN, the Cardmember must memorise it and destroy the original PIN advice. The Bank ’ s ATMs may allow the Cardmember to change the PIN (originally advised by the Bank) to a PIN of choice.

[PAGE 10]
consequences of the Cardmember ’ s valid PIN becoming known to a third party. The Cardmember will be liable for all consequences in the event of any loss due to the misuse of his/her PIN.

The Cardmember's right  to use the card shall be determined forthwith in case of such violation.  The onus of and responsibility for ensuring compliance with Foreign Exchange laws/regulations, as prevailing and/or as  applicable from time to time, prevailing   Baggage rules and EXIM policy in force, rests solely with the Cardmember.  The Cardmember accepts full responsibility for wrongful use in contravention of the laws, rules, regulations and Terms and  Conditions and undertakes to indemnify the Bank and to mak e good any loss, damage, interest, conversion, any other  financial charges and outgoings, costs and consequences that the Bank may incur and/or suffer on account of the  Cardmember and his/her acts of omission, commission, negligence etc.   CHARGES IN FOREIGN   CURRENCIES  Charges in Foreign Currencies will be converted into Indian Rupees using the exchange rate established by the Bank for  such transactions on the date when the charges are processed by the Bank or authorised agents, plus any applicable  conversion   commission. Amounts converted by third parties such as airlines or other establishments will be billed at their  rates.  STATEMENT OF ACCOUNTS  The Bank will mail a Statement of transactions in the Card Account every month on a predetermined date, to the mai ling  address provided by the Cardmember.  Non - receipt of the Statement for any reasons whatsoever is not a valid reason for non - payment of dues. Should the  Cardmember not receive the Statement within 7 days from the usual Statement date, the Cardmember is   requested to  call the HDFC Bank Credit Cards Division to check the amount payable. Requests for duplicate Statements will attract  charges as determined by the Bank from time to time. The Statement date is predetermined and cannot be changed. The  Cardmember   further agrees that the Bank may round off the bill as determined appropriate by the Bank from time to time.  The amount paid in excess of the actual bill amount will be adjusted in the next billing cycle.  The Cardmember should promptly notify the Bank of   any unauthorised transactions appearing on the Statement to enable  investigation/amendments (if necessary). These transactions should be notified/referred within 30 days from the date of  the Statement, after the expiry of which the Bank will not be liable   for any refunds that may be related to such transactions.  The Statement will have detail all transactions received and processed in the Card Account including any refunds or  payments made since the date of previous Statement and up to the close of business   on the day of the current Statement  date.  The amount outstanding on the Cardmember's Statement will be made up of the following:  The amounts charged for all goods and services purchased by the use of card including all mail and telephone order, or  over th e Internet and authorised by the Cardmember or by any (Add - on) Cardmember to be charged to the Card Account.  Cash advances on the Cardmember's Card Account including those incurred through Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)  wherever applicable.  All Balance T ransfers, if any, availed of by the Cardmember.  The charges set out elsewhere in the Cardmember Agreement (e.g., Fees, Service Charges, Service Tax etc.)  The Cardmember should check each Statement of Account carefully on receipt and immediately notify the   Bank of any  unauthorised mail or telephone order/internet, any disputed transaction or any other error.  International transactions on the HDFC Bank International Credit Card: These will be identifiable by a second memo line  appearing under the Merchant nam e   -   detailing the Foreign Currency and amount.  TRANSACTIONS  Whenever the Cardmember signs a sales slip/ charge slip , mail order form, places a telephonic/internet order, or any other  document authorising the Bank to accept a transaction on the Card Account,   the Cardmember(s) is/are agreeing to,  confirming the validity and acknowledging the amount (including and/or any fee or service charge) shown on that  document relevant to the price of the goods and/or services obtained. It must be noted that service charg es or any fees  levied are not refundable in case of a dispute.  Similarly, when the Cardmember signs a cash advance voucher, the Cardmember is agreeing to and confirming the validity  and accuracy of the amounts shown (including and/or any fee or service cha rge) shown on that voucher relevant to the  cash obtained. In some cases, the Cardmember may be requested to acknowledge the receipt of cash on the same or  separate voucher.  The Cardmember must ensure to keep copies of all such vouchers/documents in a safe   manner at least till such time as  the transaction is reflected in the Statement.  The Cardmember must not at any point, hand over the card to any other person for use. It must also be ensured that the  Cardmember is physically present at the Merchant Establi shment (except in the case of mail/telephone order/internet  transaction) at the time of the transaction.  The Cardmember must ensure that the card/PIN is not shared with any other person for usage. In the event of any such  usage it will be deemed as crimina l/civil offence as the case may be. The Bank reserves the right to proceed legally against  the Cardmember and the person suspected of such usage as per applicable laws.   The Cardmember should not use  retail/consumer   card for the purpose of funding the worki ng capital and/or other financial requirements of any business  owned by him/her.  Prior to completion of a transaction on his/her Card Account, if the Cardmember wishes to cancel the same, he/she must  advise the Merchant and ensure the destruction of the vo ucher/document in his/her presence.

[PAGE 8]
8  Where the card transaction is being processed on any electronic terminal the transaction would typically have been  completed by the time the voucher is presented for the Cardmember's signature.  In such cases, the Cardmem ber must ensure that the Merchant completes a 'refund' transaction or 'voids' the transaction  and provides the Cardmember with evidence (e.g., Credit Voucher) of the same.  The Cardmember must retain this evidence and advise the Bank if the refund does not   appear on the next Statement of  Account or if the transaction that has been voided appears in the Statement of Account.  Similarly, where a transaction is previously completed and the Merchant is subsequently willing to accept a cancellation  (e.g., Airline   or Railway Bookings etc.), the Cardmember must ensure that the Merchant completes the refund in the form  of a Credit Voucher (with the imprint of the card). The Cardmember must retain a copy of this voucher and he/she must  advise the Bank of this refund if   it does not appear on the account within thirty days from the date of cancellation.  A purchase and a subsequent credit for cancellation of goods/services like air/rail tickets are two separate transactions.  The Cardmember must pay for the purchase transac tion as it appears on the Statement, to avoid charging of any fee. The  refund will only be credited to the Card Account (less cancellation charges) as and when received from the Merchant.  FEES AND SERVICE CHARGES  The Bank reserves the right to charge the   Credit Card Account with fees and charges. The Bank is also irrevocably  authorised to debit the Credit Card Account with joining fee (as applicable) in the first year and with an annual membership  fee (as applicable) each year until the Credit Card Account   is closed. The Annual Membership Fee is payable in advance  and no refund is payable when the Credit Card Account is closed. The Primary Card and Add - on Cards will attract Annual  fees as specified from time to time. The monthly Statement of Account will de tail all such fees and charges applied to the  Credit Card Account.  The Joining and Annual fee(s) are subject to changes at the discretion of the Bank and are not refundable. The Cardmember  agrees for these fees to be charged to the monthly Statement that w ill be generated by the Bank.  INTEREST  Unless the interest - free period applies as set out below, HDFC Bank will levy an interest on any new purchase (and any  related debited charge) from the day on which the purchase (and any related debited charge) is tra nsacted on the Card  Account. The interest free period for a purchase (and any related debited charge) in any Statement period will apply if the  outstanding balance on the Card Account for the previous Statement period (if any) is paid in full by its due da te.   If the  outstanding balance on the Card Account is not paid in full by its due date, finance charge will be levied on both  statemented outstanding and new purchases   (and any related debited charge), from the date of each transaction on the  card account   till the date of complete payment is made.  HDFC Bank will charge interest on a Cash Advance from the day on which the Cash Advance is transacted on the Card  Account till the date of repayment of the Cash Advance (including cash interest accrued thereof) in   full.  HDFC Bank will ordinarily levy interest on the purchase balance outstanding on the Card Account on a daily basis by  applying its current daily percentage rate to the amount of the purchase balance outstanding at the end of each day. HDFC  Bank will l evy a finance charge on Cash Advance balances on a daily basis by applying its current daily percentage rate to  the amount of the Cash Advance balance at the end of each day.  The interest as above, will continue to be payable after termination of this agre ement or closure of the Card Account until  the card balance is cleared in full.  HDFC Bank may at any time, under intimation to the Cardmember, vary the interest to take into account prevailing interest  rates, market forces and credit and business risks. Th e Bank may offer differential rates on preferential Cardmember  behaviour. This is entirely at the discretion of the Bank and could mean revision of interest rates higher or lower than the  rate prevailing at that point of time.  GOVERNMENT FEES AND CHARGES  Various government duties, rates, taxes or charges will apply to and be payable by the Cardmember for the operation of  the Credit Card Account. The Cardmember agrees to reimburse the Bank for payment of any such taxes, rates or charges  or other similar tax es or levies payable in connection with any advances, finances or credit provided by the Bank to the  Cardmember.  Goods & Services Tax (GST)  · The applicable GST would be dependent on place of provision (POP) and place of supply (POS),If POP and POS is in t he  same state then applicable GST would be CGST and SGST/UTGST else, IGST.  ·   GST For FEE & Charges / Interest transactions Billed on statement date will reflect in next month statement.  ·   GST levied will not be reversed on Any dispute on Fee &Charges   / interest.  PAYMENTS  As per the RBI guidelines, in case the amount on account of use of the Card overseas is greater than the  Cardmember's Foreign Exchange entitlements, the Cardmember should provide the reimbursement claimed, and the Bank  is authorised   to report the matter to the Regional Office of the Exchange Control Department giving full details.  However, under no circumstances should the payment of the Credit Card bill/dues be delayed or refused on the grounds  of the Cardmember having exceeded the e ntitlement. There will be no obligation on HDFC Bank to make a claim or demand  for payment on a Cardmember and non - payment shall render the Cardmember liable to risk of withdrawal (whether  temporarily or permanently) of his card membership.   MONTHLY REPAYME NTS TO CARDMEMBER'S CARD ACCOUNT  Amounts which are payable immediately  Overlimit Amount   -   If at any time, the outstanding balance on the Statement of Account exceeds the approved Credit  Limits, this Overlimit Amount must be paid immediately.

[PAGE 9]
9  Overdue Amount   -   If 'Minimum Amount Due' remains unpaid from previous Statements of Account; these oOverdue  amounts must be paid immediately.  Amounts which are payable by the 'Due Date'  Each month the Cardmember may pay as much as he/she wishes towards the   'Closing Balance' shown on the Statement  of Account, provided the payment is not less than the amount shown on the Statement of Account as the 'Minimum  Amount Due'.  If the Cardmember does not wish to pay the full amount of the closing balance shown on the   monthly Statement of  Account he/she can avail of the Revolving Credit Facility and will need to pay only the Minimum Amount Due as shown on  Statement of Account. All payments must be made prior to the due date, irrespective of whether or not Statement has  been received by the Cardmember. Non - receipt of a Statement will not be considered a valid reason for non - payment. In  the event that the Cardmember has not received the Statement, he/she can calculate the amount based on the unpaid  chargeslips in his/her   possession.  (WEF   June ’25) ,   MAD = Total GST + EMI amount + 100% of   Fees/Charges + 5% of [Finance Charge (if any)   + Retail Spends  and Cash Advance (if any)] +Overlimit Amount (if any) .   In case 5% of (Finance Charge + Retail Spends   and Cash Advance)  is less   than Finance   Charges, then   MAD will be Total GST + EMI   amount + 100% of Fees/Charges + 100% of   Finance Charges  + 5% of [Retail Spends +   Cash Advance (if any)] + Overlimit Amount (if   any)   of the Statement Closing Balance or Rs. 200,  (or such other amount as   notified from time to time), whichever is greater. (This does not apply to cancelled or closed  Cards in case of which full outstanding amount needs to be cleared immediately on demand). If the closing balance is less  than Rs. 200 (or such other amount as   notified from time to time) it must be paid in full.  The due date for payment (which presently would be approximately 20 days from the Statement date) is the last date by  which the payments should reach the Bank. It may be noted that the due date is only a   convenience to enable Statements  to reach the Cardmember and also to provide time to process the Cardmember's payments. Future transactions on the  account may be declined if the payment is not received within the due date and all transactions will attract   service charges  from the date of purchase.  The Cardmember's payments will first be applied to all overdue amounts (the oldest due being credited first) in the  following order:  1.   Fees and other Charges  2.   Interest  3.   Balance Transfer Amount Billed (if applicable)  4.   Cash Advances Billed  5.   Retail Transactions Billed  6.   Balance Transfer Amount Current (if applicable)  7.   Cash Advances Current  8.   Retail Transactions Current  Payment will be treated as made from the date on which the payments are credited to the Card Account in the or dinary  course of business. Payments made by cheque drawn on a location where the Bank does not have a branch will be subject  to a processing and handling fee as determined by the Bank from time to time, in addition to Drawee Bank's charges for  all outstati on cheques. Generally, payments made in cash or through Direct Banking Channels will be credited to the Card  Account within 2 business days, provided, they are made prior to the close of business hours as applicable. Proceeds of  payments to the account suc h as cheques cannot be used or withdrawn until funds are confirmed as cleared. If, for any  reason (whether at Cardmember's request or otherwise) the Bank allows withdrawal or use of the proceeds of the cheque  or other such payment before it has been cleare d, the Bank will be entitled to debit the Card Account, in the event that  the cheque or other such payment is later dishonoured and the Cardmember shall be completely liable to make payments  thereof and on account thereof.  Payment towards multiple Card Acc ounts (held by the same Cardmember or otherwise) cannot be made vide a single  cheque. The Bank does not undertake the responsibility of apportionment of such payment as may be desired by the  Cardmember.  If the Cardmember is not going to be able to access h is/her mail around the period that he/she usually receives the  Statement, it would be the Cardmember's responsibility to make   arrangements to ensure that at least the   Minimum  Amount Due reaches the Bank before the Payment Due Date.  The Bank has made arra ngements to provide Drop Box facilities at various locations in serviceable cities as determined by  the Bank from time to time. The updated list of Drop Box locations may be communicated to the Cardmember as  appropriate. The Cardmember is advised to use th ese Drop Boxes to deposit only locally payable cheques or drafts along  with Payment Vouchers/stubs (tear off portion of Statement) duly completed with the cheque details.  Cardmembers are advised not to issue post - dated cheques towards card outstanding as t he Bank does not in the normal  course of operations offer to clear post - dated cheques.  Timely payment towards the card dues is essential and it is a condition of this Agreement that all payments towards  Minimum Amount Due must reach HDFC Bank on or before   the Payment Due Date indicated in the monthly Statement of  Account.  If the Minimum Amount Due is not paid by the Payment Due Date, a late payment fee as specified in the tariff sheet will  be debited to the Card Account and is subject to change at the discr etion of HDFC Bank.  Non - payment of card dues shall also render the Cardmember liable to risk of instant withdrawal of the card membership  without prior notice.   RETURNED PAYMENTS  In case the cheque or any other payment instrument forwarded by the Cardmember   is not honoured or must be returned  to the Cardmember because it cannot be processed, HDFC Bank reserves the right to proceed legally against the

[PAGE 10]
10  Cardmember and would at its discretion levy a penal fee and/or temporarily withdraw credit facilities on the   card.  Repeated instances of payment instruments not being honoured could result in cancellation of the account. A cheque  return fee at the prevailing rate would be levied on the amount of the returned cheque subject to a minimum amount as  specified by the   Bank from time to time.  The attention of the Cardmember is invited to the provisions of section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 and  to the serious criminal penalties therein specified for the dishonour of cheques.   AUTO - DEBIT  If the Cardmember h as a Current Account or a Savings Account at any of our branches in India, the Bank may at its sole  discretion arrange to have any one of these accounts debited automatically every month on the Cardmember's written  request.  The Cardmember may note that the   Auto - Debit facility will not be available on certain classes of Accounts as determined  by the Bank from time to time. Accounts currently residing in Micro Banker will not be eligible to participate in this facili ty.  The Automatic debit will be processed   on the registered account nominated by the Cardmember from the Payment Due  Date and will be credited to the Card Account. In the event of non - realization of payment in the first attempt, repeat  attempts will be made until realization of payment  Cardmember   must have sufficient cleared funds in the nominated Savings or Current Account at the time of the debit  being processed. In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to clear the Card Account balance fully (i.e., 100% Auto -  Debit) each month, but the clea red balance available in the nominated Savings or Current Account is insufficient in any  month, the Auto - Debit service will instead claim only the Minimum Amount Due (if the cleared balance in the nominated  account is sufficient to cover the Minimum Amount   Due). In such instances of nonrecovery for Total Amount Due for two  successive months, the Auto - Debit instruction for all subsequent months will be amended by the Bank to claim for the  Minimum Amount Due until receipt of fresh instructions from the custom er. Where the Auto - Debit service claims the  Minimum Amount Due, and the nominated Savings or Current Account does not have sufficient funds to meet the claim,  the amount will be reserved to Cardmember's Card Account and the Auto - Debit reversal charges at t he prevailing rate  would be levied to the Card Account. In such instance of non - recovery of Minimum Amount Due for two successive  months, the Auto - Debit instruction for all subsequent months will be cancelled until receipt of fresh instructions from the  cu stomer for incorporation of Auto Debit. The Bank reserves the right to accept and/or subsequently cancel or not accept  any such instructions.  In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and there is  a credit or a payment made to the Card Account before the Payment due date, the Bank may at its discretion claim only  the residual amount i.e., the difference between the amount outstanding as per the Statement and the payments/other  credits received befo re the Payment due date. The Bank reserves the right to amend its policies with respect to such  instructions from time to time.  In case the Cardmember has instructed the Bank to claim for amounts other than the Minimum Amount Due and in the  event of non - re covery of funds, the Bank will attempt to recover at least the Minimum Amount Due on the Card Account.  In future, the Bank may introduce at its discretion a variable option for Auto - Debit facility. Where the Cardmember has  opted for a variable amount and t he Minimum Amount Due payable on the Card Account is higher than the option  exercised, the Bank reserves the right to claim the higher of the two.  If the Auto - Debit cannot be claimed for insufficient funds on the recovery date, the Auto - Debit reversal char ges would be  levied irrespective of any other payment/credit made into the Card Account through any other mode other than Auto -  Debit.  The Bank at a predetermined overdue status would reserve the right to withdraw the standing instructions given by the  Card member without any prior notice and the facility may not be made available in future.  In a specific case where subsequent to providing instruction to the Bank to Auto - Debit a nominated account, the  nominated account is closed or transferred to another bran ch, the Cardmember undertakes to advise the Cards Services  Division of the Bank of the change in status of the nominated account. Please note that the service or penal charges that  accrue to the Cardmember's account because of non - compliance or delay of th is advice will not be refunded.  OPERATING ELECTRONIC TERMINALS  The term 'Electronic Terminal' includes:  Any HDFC Bank branch teller machines as and when introduced;  Any of the Bank's Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Cash Dispensers;  Automated Teller Ma chines (ATMs) and Cash Dispensers of other selected Banks/financial institutions; Electronic Funds  Transfer at Point of Sale (EFTPOS) terminals; and,  Any other authorised terminal or device connected to the Bank's electronic Banking system as and when intr oduced.  The Bank will specifically advise the Cardmember whenever the card is acceptable for use at our ATMs (Automated  Teller Machines) or other bank's ATMs or other specified electronic devices. In such cases, where applicable, the Bank will  provide the   Cardmember with a PIN (Personal Identification Number). The Bank reserves the right to alter the types of  accounts, which may be operated or the types of transactions, which may be undertaken using the card and PIN, at any  time. In the event that the serv ice is being provided on the card, the Bank will endeavour to maintain electronic access on  our ATMs or electronic devices/terminals unless:  An Electronic Banking Terminal malfunctions or is otherwise unavailable for use.  The Card Account is overdue or   otherwise considered irregular by the Bank.  In any of these events, electronic access to the nominated accounts may be withdrawn without prior notice to the  Cardmember, without any liability devolving upon the Bank for such withdrawal.  The Bank will advise   the Cardmember of his/her PIN in a secure manner. On receipt of this PIN, the Cardmember must  memorise it and destroy the original PIN advice. The Bank's ATMs may allow the Cardmember to change the PIN (originally

[PAGE 11]
11  advised by the Bank) to a PIN of his/her   choice. The PIN advised to the Cardmember by the Bank is confidential and must  not be made known by the Cardmember to anybody. The Bank will not be liable or responsible for any consequences of  the Cardmember's valid PIN becoming known to a third party. Th e Cardmember will be liable for all consequences in the  event of any loss due to the misuse of his/her PIN.  If, after memorising the PIN, the PIN is lost or stolen, or if the PIN becomes known to somebody else, and if the card is sti ll  in the Cardmember's   possession, he/she should immediately advise the Cards Division of the Bank. Any delays may expose  the Cardmember to the liability of unauthorised use of the card.  Subject to the Card Account being valid, if the card is retained in the ATM, the Cardmember   should contact our 24Hour  Customer Call Centre for assistance. A replaced card will be forwarded for a fee as specified by the Bank from time to time.  CHANGES TO TRANSACTIONS THROUGH TERMINALS  Any transaction made by the Cardmember at any electronic termin al cannot be cancelled, altered or changed by   the  Cardmember.   PROCESSING DATE  For transactions made at any of the Bank's ATMs and ATMs of other selected banks/financial institutions the Bank will  endeavour to process the same to the Card Account on the sa me or following business day provided they are made prior  to the close of the Bank's business hours.  PRINTED TRANSACTION RECORDS  When the Cardmember completes a transaction at an electronic terminal he/she will receive a printed transaction record.  The Car dmember must check the record carefully. The Cardmember should retain these records for verification purposes  and to aid in reconciling Account Statements.  Some of our ATMs will offer the option of not receiving a transaction record. However, it is recomme nded that the  Cardmember always choose to receive a transaction record.  TRANSACTION LIMITS  The Bank may change or impose limits on the amount of funds that are made available through electronic terminals, over  any specified period of time for transactions   that require the use of a card and PIN. Merchants and other banks/financial  institutions may also impose additional restrictions on transaction limits.   ELECTRONIC FUNDS TRANSFER AT POINT OF  SALE (EFTPOS)  When using the card at an EFTPOS terminal, the Card member agrees that the Bank will not be held responsible or liable,  unless required by law, for:  Any Bank/Financial Institution or Merchant refusing to accept or honour the card; or Any goods  or services purchased with a card  Any complaint about goods or s ervices must be resolved only with the Merchant concerned. If an EFTPOS terminal  malfunctions or is otherwise unavailable for use, alternative manual transactions may be made using the card and a  transaction voucher must be signed by the Cardmember at the   request of the Merchant.  POINT - OF - SALE (POS) TRANSACTION  When using the card at a POS terminal, the Cardmember agrees that the Bank will not be held responsible or liable, in the  event that a POS terminal malfunctions or is unavailable for use. Alternative   manual transactions may be made using the  card and a transaction voucher must be signed by the Cardmember.  INTERNET TRANSACTIONS  The Cardmember is cautioned that any transaction on the Internet resulting in any outflow of Foreign Exchange must be  made str ictly in accordance with the Exchange Control Regulations of the RBI and that in event of failure to do so the  Cardmember may be liable for penal action under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999. With a view to protect  the interest of Card members, H DFC Bank reserves the right to decline at its sole discretion, certain Internet transactions,  depending on the origin and nature of purchase. This is done with a view to protect the Cardmembers from unauthorised  or fraudulent usage of account information b y persons/parties.  DISPUTES  Any chargeslip or other payment requisition received from a Merchant Partner by HDFC Bank for payment shall be  conclusive proof that the charge recorded on such chargeslip or other requisition, was properly incurred for the amou nt  and by the Cardmember referred to in that chargeslip or other requisition, as the case may be, by the use of the Credit  Card, except where the Credit Card has been lost, stolen or fraudulently misused, the burden of proof for which shall be  on the Cardm ember and for which prior intimation to the Bank must be provided by the Cardmember. The other payment  requisition referred to in this clause shall include any and all payments pertaining to permissible expenses incurred by a  Cardmember at a Merchant Partn er by use of the card which is not recorded on a chargeslip.  If the Cardmember believes that an error has occurred in the Statement he/she should promptly inform the Bank in writing,  (so that the same is received by the Bank within 30 days of the date of S tatement in which the transaction under dispute  was charged). The operating rules applicable under the Credit Card Scheme impose time limits on reporting disputed  transactions. If the Cardmember does not report/inform the Bank within time, this makes it di fficult for the Bank to gather  information about the transactions and this may work to the Cardmember's disadvantage.  It is therefore advisable to notify the Bank of any disputed transactions immediately upon receipt of the Statement of  Account. This inclu des any disputes regarding Reward Points (if applicable) allocated to the Card Account. To assist the  Bank with its investigations, the Cardmember will need to provide the following information:   Cardmember name and card  number  Details of the transaction in   question  Wherever necessary the Bank will contact the Cardmember should it need any further information. Pending the Bank's  investigation and correction (if any), the Bank may, at its sole discretion, credit the Cardmember's account with the  disputed amou nt and debit the appropriate Reward Points (if applicable) till a conclusion is arrived in respect of the

[PAGE 12]
12  dispute. Where, after completion of investigations, the Bank concludes that no error has occurred, the Bank may advise  the Cardmember accordingly, and   the account if already credited will be promptly debited for the disputed amount with  relevant credit of Reward Points (if applicable) with the original transaction date, and interest will accrue accordingly. If ,  in the process of investigating the Cardme mber's query, the Bank has had to retrieve voucher copies either from its  archives or through another bank entity, the Cardmember's account will be debited for retrieval fees as specified by the  Bank from time to time. Amounts due on the transactions inclu ding disputed transactions are payable by the due date  appearing on the Statement of Accounts.  In case of any dispute on an Add - on Cardmember usage, a copy of the chargeslip in a card present environment will be  deemed to be conclusive proof of usage by th e Add - on Cardmember and will be binding on the Primary Cardmember to  construe the same as valid/due and payable. During the course of any interaction on the disputed transactions, the Bank  may, at its sole discretion, record the facts, evidences, telephoni c conversations with the customer for the purpose of  investigation.  The Courts in Chennai, India, shall have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with all disputes between the Bank and the  Cardmember, or the estate of the Cardmember and the Cardmember hereby irr evocably and unconditionally agrees to  submit him/her to such exclusive jurisdiction.   SECURITY TIP  Please ensure your mobile number and email ID is updated with the Bank.

The Bank will credit the Card Account as appropriate  on receipt of the proceeds from the processing Bank. However, any Char ge/Finance charge(s) resulting from delay at any  parties' end to process the credit will need to be borne by the Cardmember.  The Ticket Deposit Receipt is not a valid credit note and the Bank would be unable to take up the matter with the concerned  member   Bank for processing the credit. Cardmembers must submit the Ticket Deposit Receipt to the concerned Railway  Authorities within the specified time period (as applicable from time to time) and obtain a credit voucher. In the absence  of a valid credit vouche r, the Bank would be unable to credit the Card Account.  The Cardmember hereby indemnifies the Bank fully against any liability (civil or criminal), loss, cost, expenses or damages  that may arise due to non credit of the cancelled ticket amount by the conce rned authorities/member Banks.  FUEL ON CREDIT/RAILWAY SURCHARGE  The Cardmember can use the HDFC Bank International Credit Card to buy fuel (petrol, diesel or other petroleum products  or automobile related services or other merchandise at petrol pumps) on c redit at select petrol pumps across the country  or for certain online/Point of Sale transactions. Depending on the arrangement those organisations have with their  member banks, the transaction will attract a service fee from the member bank and any taxes t hereon, which may vary  from time to time. This charge cannot be suppressed, and is due and payable.  Currently all tickets booked with the Railways using the Credit Card would attract a handling charge from the member  Bank at a fixed percentage/amount, whic h cannot be suppressed and is due and payable.  Transactions   done   using   the   Card   Account   may   in   the   future   attract   similar   charges   as   specified   by   the  Franchise/Authorities. Intimation as appropriate will be given by the Bank to the Card member f rom time to time.   QUALITY  OF GOODS AND SERVICES  HDFC Bank shall not be in anyway responsible for merchandise, merchandise warranty or services purchased or availed of  by the Cardmember from Merchant Partners including on account of delay in delivery, non - d elivery, nonreceipt of goods  or receipt of defective goods by the Cardmember.
